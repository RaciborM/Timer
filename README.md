## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The Stopwatch is an internet application that allows users to measure time precisely. The application offers features such as an archive of recent times and the ability to change the interface color, allowing for personalization of the application's appearance.


##Features
Precise Time Measurement: Enables users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch with millisecond accuracy.
Archive of Recent Times: Stores the history of recent measured times, allowing users to review and compare results.
Interface Color Change: Users can customize the interface color to their preferences by choosing from various available color themes.
Responsive Design: The application is optimized for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


##Technologies Used
JavaScript: Handles the stopwatch logic, time management, and user interactions.
HTML: Structures the content of the application, including start, stop, reset buttons, and the archive list.
CSS: Styles the application's interface, ensuring an aesthetic look and the ability to change colors.


##How It Works
Start/Stop: The user can start and stop the stopwatch using the start and stop buttons.
Reset: The reset button allows the user to reset the stopwatch.
Time Archive: After stopping the stopwatch, the measured time is saved in the archive, which is displayed on the page.
Color Change: The user can select their preferred interface color from the available options, allowing for personalization of the application's appearance.


##Additional Features
Data Export: The ability to export saved times to a CSV file.
Sound Notifications: Optional sound notifications informing about the start and stop of the stopwatch.
Night Mode: An option to switch the interface to night mode, reducing eye strain when using the application in a dark environment.

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
